# Chatbox

Currently only Streamlabs Chatbox is supported, but there may be more in the future

## Streamlabs

- Go to [Streamlabs Chatbox](https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/chatbox)
- Scroll down to JS (enable Custom HTML/CSS if not already)
- Replace the current JS with what is in [/custom-javascript.js](https://github.com/KK964/Twitch-Pronouns-Bot/blob/main/ChatBox/custom-javascript.js)
- - If you are self hosting and not using the official database, change `DOMAIN` to use your domain
